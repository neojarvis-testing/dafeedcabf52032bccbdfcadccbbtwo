Lab 2: Exploring Hadoop and HDFS Commands

Objective: Gain hands-on with HDFS commands in pseudo-distributed mode.

Steps:

Start Hadoop in pseudo-distributed mode (or use a Docker setup).

Run basic HDFS commands:

hdfs dfs -mkdir /data

hdfs dfs -put localfile.txt /data/

hdfs dfs -ls /data

hdfs dfs -cat /data/localfile.txt

hdfs fsck /data/localfile.txt -files -blocks

Observe block size, replication factor, and logs.
